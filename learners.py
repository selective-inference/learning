        Learn a function

        where N is the sufficient statistic corresponding to nuisance parameters and T is our target.
        The random variable Y is 

        Y = check_selection(algorithm(new_sampler))

        That is, we perturb the center of observed_sampler along a ray (or higher-dimensional affine
        subspace) and rerun the algorithm, checking to see if the test `check_selection` passes.

        For full model inference, `check_selection` will typically check to see if a given feature
        is still in the selected set. For general targets, we will typically condition on the exact observed value 
        of `algorithm(observed_sampler)`.

        Parameters
        ----------

        algorithm : callable
            Selection algorithm that takes a noise source as its only argument.

        observed_set : set(int)
            The purported value `algorithm(observed_sampler)`, i.e. run with the original seed.

        feature : int
            One of the elements of observed_set.

        observed_sampler : `normal_source`
            Representation of the data used in the selection procedure.

        learning_proposal : callable
            Proposed position of new T to add to evaluate algorithm at.
