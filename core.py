    Notes
    -----

    This function makes the assumption that covariance in observed sampler is the 
    true covariance of S and we are looking for inference about coordinates of the mean of 

    np.linalg.inv(covariance).dot(S)

    this allows us to compute the required observed_target, cross_cov and target_cov.

    For full model inference, `check_selection` will typically check to see if a given feature
    is still in the selected set. For general targets, we will typically condition on the exact observed value
